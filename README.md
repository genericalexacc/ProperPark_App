# ProperPark_App
React Native app built during a hackathon.

Proper parkâ€™s purpose is to translate multiple parking signs into an easily read format so that restrictions are respected and parking tickets are avoided.
By snapping a picture of the parking panels, the mobile app deciphers the rest for you.

## 1st place winner at Polytechnique Hackathon
